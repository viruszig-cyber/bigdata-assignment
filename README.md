The assessment is a group project assignment only.
These project assignments are due on the 15th of December 2023 and contributes 50
percent to your overall Data Analytics course grade. The analytics should be done with
Zimbabwean and African data sets only. If you are going to use data from your company,
please make sure it is anonymized.
The exam contributes 50 percent of your overall Data Analytics course grade.
Big Data Technology Project Assignment
2023The project has a rubric. A rubric is a scoring guide used to evaluate the quality of students
constructed responses. Rubrics contain evaluative criteria, quality definitions for those criteria at
particular levels of achievement, and a scoring strategy. Marks are awarded based on each
rubric metric. Please make sure you fulfill all the rubric requirements for each project.
All the documentation and diagrams that explain your analytics thought process has to be
within the Jupyter Notebook .
Group Challenge â€“ Data Analytics Creativity and Innovation Challenge
Showcase any data analytics of your choice using Machine Learning/Deep learning to
demonstrate your understanding and skills you have acquired in Data Analytics. The point of this
exercise is to showcase your creativity and innovation with data analytics. This project has to be
a master piece of data analytics. You are free to use any Machine learning algorithm of your
choice but you are still restricted to using Zimbabwean and African datasets only and this is
nonnegotiable. Submit this project as a detailed Jupyter Notebook with all the project outputs
with either your dataset or a link to where the dataset can be downloaded. All your group student
registration numbers and names should be clearly stated in the notebook.
